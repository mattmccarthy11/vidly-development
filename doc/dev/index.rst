MediaDrop is developed on top of Pylons 0.10, but borrows some ideas from
TurboGears 2.0 (esp. see the decorators in mediadrop.lib.decorators, and the
form widgets). Pylons conventions are generally followed, so experienced Pylons
and TurboGears2 developers should feel comfortable.

.. note::

   This documentation is intended the technically inclined who want to
   understand how MediaDrop works under the hood. If you're looking for
   a simple guide to *using* the web app itself, please refer to the
   :ref:`User Guide <user_toplevel>`.
